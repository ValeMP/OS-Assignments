# COL331-Assignments
This repository contains the code for the assignments of the course *COL331 - Operating Systems.*

For all the three assignments, we worked with the [xv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xv6) operating system. Specifically, we modified the xv6 kernel to achieve many new functionalities like **System Call tracing and management**, **Priority based Scheduling and handling of Starvation**, **User Level Threads**, **Co-operative Scheduling** and much more. 

For more details, please refer to **problem.pdf** for the exact problem statement.

Team-mates: For Assignment 3, I collaborated with *Yash Garg (2015EE10691)* from the Electrical Engineering Department.
